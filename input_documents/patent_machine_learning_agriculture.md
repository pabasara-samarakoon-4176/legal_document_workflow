# üåæ MACHINE LEARNING OPTIMIZATION THROUGH RANDOMIZED AUTONOMOUS CROP PLANTING

---

## üß† Abstract

Systems and methods automate the design and execution of randomized experiments. Portions of a field are planted using an agricultural vehicle configured to randomly vary planting parameters when planting a portion of the field. A resulting crop outcome across each portion or sub-portion of the field is observed.

A training set of data is generated that includes the varied planting parameters and the associated crop outcomes for each portion of the field. A machine-learned model is trained using the training set and is configured to predict crop outcomes based on historical and forecast conditions and applied parameters. The model is used to identify optimal planting parameters in future planting cycles.

## üìù Description

This invention relates to intelligent agriculture systems and experimentation frameworks. Traditional crop optimization is limited by linear experimentation, which lacks environmental variability and generalizability. The proposed method leverages:

- Autonomous agricultural machinery
- Randomized variable planting parameters (e.g., seed depth, spacing, moisture)
- On-field outcome observation
- Iterative model refinement

A machine learning model predicts optimal configurations by incorporating:
- Weather forecasts
- Soil sensor input
- Yield data from past seasons

The system is designed for both large-scale agricultural operations and precision-farming contexts.
