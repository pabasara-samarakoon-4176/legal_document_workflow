## 📝 Executive Summary
Legal analysis completed with human review.

## 📄 Finalized Clauses
### Confidentiality Clause
Finalized clause after review.

## ⚠️ Flagged Issues
1. The 'Purpose' clause lacks specificity in defining 'adverse to the interests' and relies heavily on Contractor's sole discretion, which may lead to ambiguity.
2. The 'Confidentiality_1' clause does not explicitly state the consequences of breach or the duration of confidentiality obligations.
3. The 'Confidentiality_2' clause is incomplete and does not fully define 'Confidential Information'.

## ✅ Recommendations
1. Ensure completeness of termination clause
